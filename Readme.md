## 2024

| Book | Score | Review | Additional Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ---------------- |
| The Phoenix Project | 3/5 | Though this book is highly regarded, I didn't love it. The narrative format is useful to help educate about DevOps principles, but the characters were such caricatures that it distracted from the delivery. For me this book had the wrong combo of technical and non-technical, I would have preferred a more technical book about DevOps practices alternatively a narrative with a more compelling story/characters. | TODO take some notes on highlights from the book |
