| Book | Score | Genre | Format |  Review | Additional Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| The Phoenix Project | 3/5 | technical novel | audiobook | Though this book is highly regarded, I didn't love it. The narrative format is useful to help educate about DevOps principles, but the characters were such caricatures that it distracted from the delivery. For me this book had the wrong combo of technical and non-technical, I would have preferred a more technical book about DevOps practices alternatively a narrative with a more compelling story/characters. | Some key points from the book are thinking about Dev and IT Ops similar to Manufacturing (much of the book is a digital analog of a book called *The Goal*), the authors propose 3 ways which are principles to improve Operations. The three ways are flow,  feedback, and continuous learning and improvement. Flow is focused on identifying workflows, streamlining the workflows and focusing on customer needs. Feedback is aimed at gathering information about the processes and then using that information to identify problem areas.  The third way is about going beyond and building continuous learning and experimentation into the culture. Some other key ideas are blameless post-mortems, making sure measures are important to delivering the actual business goals, and being able to gain visibility to the whole IT process. | 
| Effective IAM for AWS: Secure AWS with IAM Built for Continuous Delivery | 4/5 | technical | kindle | This book had good coverage of IAM, organizational issues, the complexity of IAM in AWS, and gave some good information on how to approach IAM from a least-privileges perspective and how to automate IAM security when possible. I think there could have been more information about actually implementing IAM security, I also think talking about the trade-offs of having to manage so many different policies and how to do that well would be nice. Overall it's a good book to read to learn more about IAM technical details and to think about the process of improving IAM policies. | Talks about different components of the IAM lifecycle: Process Controller: this component is what communicates the desired state. Actuator: this component takes the desired state and makes the running state match desired state. Sensor: this component is used to measure the state after the actuator runs, this can catch implementation failures as well as configuration drift. |
